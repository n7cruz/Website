					Of course, I also have experience as a web developer, as I have created this website myself and from scratch. It's hosted on a shared linux based server and I used bootstrap extensively, borrowing many of the components from their library. It took me about 2 days as a complete beginner to get to the point that it is now, and so far only uses basic javascript to make it a little dynamic. It is completely responsive but there are some issues with the windows-based chrome browser as for whatever reason, they don't handle some units correctly. However, on every other browser including IE it seems to work fine, including a phone.<br> <br>

					In the future I plan to make this page more dynamic by implementing the React framework. I also plan to include mongoDB database to gain more experience in a non-sql environment. I plan to use node.js to achieve this as I believe technologies are moving further away from the traditional PHP SQL environment to emergent tech such as mongoDB and node.
